## Operating Ironic: Running A Young OpenStack Project In Production

This is a talk that I gave at the OpenStack Vancouver summit about how we took a very early stage OpenStack project (OpenStack Ironic) and ran it in product to offer Rackspace's OnMetal project. The driver and decommissioning tools that we built were mostly open source and would be included in Ironic eventually. I took point on the upstreaming of decommissioning.
